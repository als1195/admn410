				<h2> History </h2>
		
			
				<p> Ed and Jackie back in the 1900s came up with this place and founded it. 
				They started with two cows and a beaten up shop and turned it into the successful buisness it has become today.
				 They were locals in Sudbury and wanted to build a place where family and friends could enjoy some sweet treats. 
				 As the years went on they grew their buisness with more cows and workers. 
				 They cared very much for the cows and only wanted the cows to eat the healthiest grass. 
				 They use regenerative agriculture to improve the health of their soil.
				  They use less fertiliztion and irrigation. This practice also increases insects and decreases pesticides.
				 They not only care about what the cows are eating but this regeneratice agriculture is a mjor effect on the environment. </p>
