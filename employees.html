			<p> James is our farmer, he is Angelina's Husband. James always had a love of cows and worked on farms his entire life.
			When Crazy Cones started to grow, the ice cream shop needed more cows and that is where Angelina met James. James learned
			Ed and Jackies regenerative agriculture technique and thought it was a great idea. James then started to work for them and has
			continued to work here since. James and his team spend most of their time on the farm making sure the soil and grass are 
			environmentally friendly. James' favorite cow is Daisy and James' favorite ice cream flavor is Vanilla! </p>
